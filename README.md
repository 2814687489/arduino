This repository contains the files and other additions for the 
'hardware/arduino' sub-directory in the arduino development environment 
that are necessary for supporting specific ATXmega CPU's.


This software is provided 'as-is' with no warranty, implied or otherwise


NOTE:  in some cases there may be USB vendor IDs or product IDs that have
been placed into the code FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.  Under NO
circumstances are you to ship ANY products with these IDs in place.  They
are only assigned for demonstration purposes, primarily so that the code
will compile without errors or user-side edits.

If your 'FOSS' product needs a vendor ID and product ID, you might try
