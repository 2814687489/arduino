This is a modification of the Arduino bootloader, which is derived from the
Adafruit bootloader 'as downloaded' that builds on POSIX-compatible systems 
and uses an AVRISPmkII to program the target.

  make xmega; make flashboot

ABOUT THE HARDWARE
------------------

The cc0 xmega32e5 breakout board used to be available from

https://www.tindie.com/products/andete/atxmega32e5-breakout-board/

However, it appears that the board is no longer being supported.

Since I happen to have access to one of these (which was part of an initial
evaluation of xmega processors for a customer project), I have included a
board layout.

This particular board requires 'shifting' the serial pins, which can be on
port C pins 2 and 3 (normal settings), or port C pins 6 and 7 (the 'shifted'
settings).  The xmega processor allows you to do this particular kind of
re-configuration, and this is what the wiring of the 'cc0' board needs to
happen.


In many ways it is a good example of a hardware variant implementation.

A few items worth noting:

1.  default serial on PORTC pins 6, 7 (as mentioned)
2.  default LED on Port R, pin 1
3.  bootloader uses 'arduino' protocol
4.  serial pinout works with Adafruit 3.3v USB serial adaptor or the
    'FTDI friend' as long as you don't wire up the 5V pin on the connector.
5.  tested most recently with 'Blink' script using newest bootloader and
    'work in progress' IDE (1/30/2017).
