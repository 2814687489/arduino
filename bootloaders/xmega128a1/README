ATXMega128A1 bootloader (currently NOT tested, does not support >64k images)

This is a modification of the Arduino bootloader, which is derived from the
Adafruit bootloader 'as downloaded' that builds on POSIX-compatible systems 
and uses an AVRISPmkII to program the target.

  make xmega; make flash
